# Browsercraft

## What is it

Thanks to [Cheerpj](https://cheerpj.com), this project runs an alpha version of Minecraft (1.2.5) on the browser, without the requirement of having the JVM locally installed on the computer.

See [the website](https://browsercraft.cheerpj.com) for a live demo and more information.

## Notes

Since this is a demo the playing time is restricted to 3 minutes; see [here](https://www.minecraft.net) for the full game.

This is not an official Minecraft product. It is not approved by or associated with Mojang or Microsoft, furthermore, the original JARs of the game are downloaded from the ufficial website and used untouched.
